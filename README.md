## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (1.70 or later)
- [Tauri CLI](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sabry-awad97/smart-scanner.git
cd smart-scanner
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
# Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# Install Rust dependencies (automatic during build)
```

3. Configure the camera URL:
   - Open `src/App.tsx`
   - Update the `cameraUrl` constant with your IP camera URL

## Development

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

This will launch the application in development mode with hot-reload enabled.

## Building

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run tauri build
```

The built application will be available in the `src-tauri/target/release` directory.
